# ESNext + ESBuild + React Template
Yet another React base template designed with simplicity in the tool-chain and strong opinions in the coding style.

- Supports as modern of ES standard as possible (ESNext).
- Uses eslint to enforce ALL React, React-Hooks, and StandardJS coding rules and styles.
- Uses ESBuild to transpile and bundle.
- Includes Browser-sync for dev server.

(WIP)
